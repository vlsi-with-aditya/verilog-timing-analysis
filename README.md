Structural Verilog propagation delay analysis
This project demonstrates propagation delay analysis in a
multi-level combinational circuit using structural Verilog.

### Circuit Description
The circuit consists of NAND, AND, NOR and NOT gates with
different propagation delays.

### Tools Used
- Icarus Verilog
- GTKWave

### Key Learnings
- How propagation delay accumulates along the longest path
- Manual critical path calculation
- Timing verification using waveform analysis
